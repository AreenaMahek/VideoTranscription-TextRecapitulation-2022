"The broad range of Pacific Alaskan salmon has resulted in the creation of a complex and multiorganizational system of management that includes the state of Alaska, various federal departments, a Congressionally-mandated fishery council, and a number of commercial and nongovernmental fish organizations. In the Bering Sea salmon are caught by the commercial groundfish fleet as by-catch. On the Yukon River salmon are commercially and traditionally"
"My research findings indicate that Bering Sea fisheries occur where juvenile salmon mature, directly impacting Yukon River salmon populations. Further, the research reflects that although Yukon salmon populations have plummeted, a recent effort was made to open the northern Bering Sea, which includes the Yukon River coastal shelf, to deep-sea commercial fishing."
"GIS is a powerful tool that can be used to locate springs sourced in ophiolites. The unique features associated with these springs include a reducing subsurface environment reacting at low temperatures producing high pH, Ca-rich formation fluids with high dissolved hydrogen and methane. Because of their unique chemical characteristics, these areas are often associated with microbes and are thought to be similar to the features that enabled life to evolve on Earth. Locating and sampling these springs could offer a deeper look into Earth's deep biosphere and the history of life on Earth. Springs have tradiitionally been located using expensive and time consuming field techniques. Field work can be dangerous. The goal of this study was to develop a model that could locate these unique geological features without first going into the field, thus"
"Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron storage and detoxification protein found highly conserved in species from bacteria to plants to humans. In mammals, ferritin is composed of two functionallyand genetically distinct subunit types, H (heavy, ~21,000 Da) and L (light, ~19,000 Da) subunits which co-assemble in various ratios with tissue specific distribution to form a shell-like protein. The H-subunit is responsible for the fast conversion of Fe(II) to Fe(III) by dioxygen (or H2O2) whereas the L-subunit is thought to contribute to the nucleation of the iron core. In the present work, we investigated the iron oxidation and deposition mechanism in two recombinant heteropolymers ferritin samples of ~20H:4L (termed H/L) and ~22L:2H"
"We assessed the oral health of the Pine Ridge Oglala Lakota people, described a new oral health assessment tool for Indigenous people, and suggested ways to improve Native oral health. The Check Up Study team of dentist and dental hygienists performed examinations of teeth and oral soft tissue for a convenience sample of 292 adults and children. Screening personnel counted the number of decayed, filled, sealed and total teeth, used probes to"
"It was hypothesized that the composite filters (citrus + sand +charcoal) will decrease the heavy metal concentration, neutralize the pH, and decrease the TDS after filtration. It was also hypothesized that a higher percentage of Daphnia magna will survive in the filtered water as compared to the unfiltered water"
