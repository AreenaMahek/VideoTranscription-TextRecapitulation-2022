"Using GIS Site Suitability Analysis to Study Adaptability and Evolution of Life: Locating Springs in Mantle Units of Ophiolites Alexandrea Bowman, University of Rhode Island GIS is a powerful tool that can be used to locate springs sourced in ophiolites. The unique features associated with these springs include a reducing subsurface environment reacting at low temperatures producing high pH, Ca-rich formation fluids with high dissolved hydrogen and methane. Because of their unique chemical characteristics, these areas are often associated with microbes and are thought to be similar to the features that enabled life to evolve on Earth. Locating and sampling these springs could offer a deeper look into Earth's deep biosphere and the history of life on Earth. Springs have tradiitionally been located using expensive and time consuming field techniques. Field work can be dangerous. The goal of this study was to develop a model that could locate these unique geological features without first going into the field, thus saving time, money and reducing the risks associated with remote field localities. A GIS site suitability analysis works by overlaying existing geo-referenced data into a computer program and adding the different data sets after assigning a numerical value to the important fields. For this project, I used surface and ground water maps, geologic maps, a soil map, and a fault map for four counties in Northern California. The model has demonstrated that it is possible to use this time of model and apply it to a complex geologic area to produce a usable field map for future field work."
Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron storage and detoxification protein found highly conserved in species from bacteria to plants to humans. In mammals, ferritin is composed of two functionallyand genetically distinct subunit types, H (heavy, ~21,000 Da) and L (light, ~19,000 Da) subunits which co-assemble in various ratios with tissue specific distribution to form a shell-like protein. The H-subunit is responsible for the fast conversion of Fe(II) to Fe(III) by dioxygen (or H2O2) whereas the L-subunit is thought to contribute to the nucleation of the iron core. In the present work, we investigated the iron oxidation and deposition mechanism in two recombinant heteropolymers ferritin samples of ~20H:4L (termed H/L) and ~22L:2H (termed L/H) ratios. Data indicates that iron oxidation occurs mainly on the H-subunit with a stoichiometry of 2Fe(II):1O2, suggesting formation of H2O2. The H/L sample completely regenerates its ferroxidase activity within a short period of time suggesting rapid movement of Fe(III) from the ferroxidase center to the cavity to form the mineral core, consistent with the role of L-chain in facilitating iron turn-over at the ferroxidase center of the H-subunit. In L/H, Fe(II) oxidation and mineralization appears to occur by two simultaneous pathways at all levels of iron additions: a ferroxidation pathway with a 2Fe(II)/1O2 ratio and a mineralization pathway with a 4Fe(II)/1O2 resulting in an average net stoichiometry of ~3Fe(II)/1O2. These results illustrate how recombinant heteropolymer ferritins control iron and oxygen toxicity while providing a safe reservoir for reversible uptake and release of iron for use by the cell."
"An Assessment of Oral Health on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation Joaquin R Gallegos, Terry Batliner, DDS, MBA, John T Brinton, MS, Dallas M Daniels, RDH, BS, Anne Wilson, DDS, MS, Maxine Janis, MPH, RDH, Kimberly E Lind, MPH, Deborah H Glueck, PhD, Judith Albino, PhD. Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health, University of Colorado, Colorado School of Public Health We assessed the oral health of the Pine Ridge Oglala Lakota people, described a new oral health assessment tool for Indigenous people, and suggested ways to improve Native oral health. The Check Up Study team of dentist and dental hygienists performed examinations of teeth and oral soft tissue for a convenience sample of 292 adults and children. Screening personnel counted the number of decayed, filled, sealed and total teeth, used probes to measure periodontal disease, and screened for oral lesions. Half of adults had 27 or fewer teeth. Sixteen percent of adults had at least one tooth with a pocket depth > 6mm. Participants had higher numbers of decayed teeth (p"
"The purpose of this experiment was to test the effectiveness of composite filters made from citrus peels and citrus pectin along with charcoal and sand on removing heavy metal pollutants from the waters of Tar Creek. A toxicity test was also done before and after filtration using Daphnia magna. Charcoal and sand were used as filtrates to decrease the TDS and neutralize the pH of the water after filtration. Daphnia magna were used as toxicity test before and after filtration. It was hypothesized that the composite filters (citrus + sand +charcoal) will decrease the heavy metal concentration, neutralize the pH, and decrease the TDS after filtration. It was also hypothesized that a higher percentage of Daphnia magna will survive in the filtered water as compared to the unfiltered water. Water samples were collected from four different sites at Tar Creek. Each water sample went through four different citrus filters plus one control (sand + charcoal). All the citrus filters decreased the heavy metal concentration after filtration. All of the filters neutralized the pH. The citrus peel filters for Site 4 were the only filters to have a pH of 7 after filtration. Only 25% of the citrus filters decreased the TDS after filtration, while 50% of the control filters decreased the TDS after filtration. A higher percentage of Daphnia magna survived after filtration. The orange peel had the overall highest survival of Daphnia after filtration. The correlation observed before and after filtration was cadmium was most toxic to Daphnia magna."
"The Southwest shrub Juniperus communis (Juniper Berry) has many significant medicinal value in the Native American culture that has not been proven scientifically. One of the popular uses of Juniper berries aside from its detoxifying action is its potential to repel insects. This study focuses on the development of insect repellant from its essential oil obtained through steam distillation. 50 g of fresh berries was collected and dried for 5 days and is placed in a still tank with 100 mL of water for steam distillation using the Flinn Scientific Borosilicate Lab Kit. Gather the extracted oil and dilute 70% in three separate containers to be transferred into spray bottles. Testing involved the spraying of the dilute sample into a class jar with Anopheles juidthae (common NM mosquito) and compared this to the effect of a commercial insect repellant. After testing and comparing the result, the commercial insect repellant significantly showed that it is a better insect repellant compared to the J. communis diluted essential oil. However, the essential oil has also an insect repellant potential"

"The broad range of Pacific Alaskan salmon has resulted in the creation of a complex and multiorganizational system of management that includes the state of Alaska, various federal departments, a Congressionally-mandated fishery council, and a number of commercial and nongovernmental fish organizations. In the Bering Sea salmon are caught by the commercial groundfish fleet as by-catch. On the Yukon River salmon are commercially and traditionally harvested for both economic and cultural sustenance by the Yup’ik residents of the Yukon Delta. Declining salmon populations has driven scientific research which considers the effects of Bering Sea salmon by-catch. My research findings indicate that Bering Sea fisheries occur where juvenile salmon mature, directly impacting Yukon River salmon populations. Further, the research reflects that although Yukon salmon populations have plummeted, a recent effort was made to open the northern Bering Sea, which includes the Yukon River coastal shelf, to deep-sea commercial fishing. By researching the relationship of policy to cultural salmon dependence, it becomes evident that Alaskan salmon-tribes are excluded from salmon management and decision-making. Legal research reflects that three basic federal Indian concepts – inherent rights, Indian Country, and tribal right of occupancy – emerge as potential foundations that may allow Alaskan salmontribes to begin sharing legal responsibility over salmon. Yukon River salmon are an international and anadromous species that require multiorganizational management. My research reflects that current management favors the Bering Sea commercial fishing industry, despite data indicating Bering Sea fisheries impact Yukon salmon populations and an overall downward trend in Yukon salmon populations."
"Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes. As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices."
"A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle that is used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people instead of goods.[1][2]The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[3][4][5] Cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.[6] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[6] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.[7][8] The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[9] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change."
